				<h3>Here I have some projects that I'm doing or I wanna do in the future.</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>HealthApp</h4>
						<p>
							An app that predicts what should you eat, your possible diseases and how to prevent them, based on your data.
							<a href='https://github.com/rubenayla/healthApp' class="nav-item nav-link">Link to the project (GitHub)</a>

						<h4>A political system based on the internet</h4>
						<p>
							The idea is to have a computer system (probably decentralized, like the blockchain) in which we develop our political rights.
						</p>
						<p>
							I wanna make politics easier and faster, and most importantly, guarantee that democracy works, with transparency and the true ability to vote what we want for ourselves.

							The system would contain the 'Constitution' of our country, and probably would explain which laws are aplicable for each person if that person has a profile with it's characteristics.
						</p>
						<p>
							The most important part would be the voting system. Everyone should be able to make a proposal at anytime, and should be able to see and filter the proposals of other people. That would behave like a social network (like, vote, share...), but with a more advanced voting/liking system. To really vote a proposal you should understand and accept the consequences like a contract. If you want to build something, you will have to pay for it. (Responsibility to take action if your proposal is successful, pay more taxes for some service...). Also, if you want to make a proposal upon other proposal or change the details, people should be able to easily vote you, and choose how to change the main proposal based on your modifications (like an open source community working with github).
							Depending on the conditions you could vote proposals near you (your city etc), and bigger general changes of the entire country. Possibly have more inluence near you with local changes, depending on who pays and who benefits...
						</p>
						<p>
							This system would guarantee transparency, and would make corruption impossible. Everyone should be able to see how money flows between public institutions, and the program would make the money flow based on the results of the proposals, instead of by the decision of someone.

							I think that we could make changes to the software itself through the main system of proposals, recursively, to add more functionalities.
						</p>
						<p>
							If a task is too specific, we could choose someone to make the decisions and plan everything to work, and then, choose if we like it. Obviously we don't have to vote everything, and the details to make a political system stable, preventing fast random changes of opinion, has to be worked.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Solar Plane</h4>
						<p>
							The objective: A solar autonomous plane that can fly continuously without having to land.
						</p>
						<p>
							I can see a lot of possibilities, and the fact that I have to learn more to understand which are the best ones.
							If the plane flies at the stratosphere, it would have all the available daylight, and would only have to worry about having enough energy to fly overnight. It could have a lot of (heavy) batteries. It could climb during the day and glide during the night. It could have a combination of both methods. It could somehow look for upwind winds. I don't know which altitude and speed would be optimal... But I like the idea and will try to solve those problems.
